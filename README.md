# Understanding the Kubernetes Source Code
A place to share links that might help to speed up understanding of the Kubernetes source code

## Reasoning
Diving into the [Kubernetes source code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) can easily become overwhelming. This repository is a collection of links that might help to speed up understanding of the Kubernetes source code. Its fairly unordered atm, but I hope to improve it over time.

## Contributing
If you have a link that you think might help others to understand the Kubernetes source code, feel free to open a PR.
